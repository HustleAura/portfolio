  "During my summer intern at Microsoft, I worked in the SCIM (Security, Compliance and Incident Management) organisation. My work involved developing a prototype for a new in-house microservice which would replace a third-party service with the same efficiency and functionality and bring down the cost of the entire processing pipeline. The final prototype when tested in real-time cost 80% less as compared to the outsourced service and still functioned with the same efficiency, bringing down the cost of the entire pipeline by 15%.";

  "I got selected in the final project round of Microsoft Engage 2022 as a mentee. In the final round, all mentees were asked to develop an application under one of three choosable tracks (face recognition, data analytics and recommendation algorithms) under the supervision of a mentor. During the one month long challenge I developed Bookify, a functional prototype of e-book reading app. The key feature of the app was a content based recommendation model which recommends books based on the user’s preference.";
